# Definition
## Radio broadcasting 
Radio broadcasting is the transmission of audio (sound), sometimes with related metadata, by radio waves intended to reach a wide audience.

## Broadcasting
Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model.

# History of radio technolology
## Maxwell’s prediction
  1864: James Clerk Maxwell proved: 
  + Any electrical disturbance could produce an effect at a considerable distance from the point at which it occurred
  + Electromagnetic energy could travel outward from a source as waves moving at the speed of light.

## Heinrich Hertz and radio-wave experiments
 Hertz's Experiment:
   + 1 spark gap at the centre of a parabolic metal mirror
   + Another spark gap connected with a wire ring: 1.5m away at the focus of another parabolic collector (in line with the first)
   + Obserse: A spark jumped across the first gap => A smaller spark jumped across the 2nd gap
   => Heinrich Hertz showed that:
      * The waves travelled in straight lines
      * They could be reflected by a metal sheet

## Marconi’s development of wireless telegraphy
  Marconi's Experiment: (repeated Hertz’s experiments with small modifications)
    + One side of the primary spark gap: attached to an elevated wire (antenna)
    + Other side: attached to Earth
    => The distance between transmitter and receiver was gradually increased ( max: 3 km)
    + The secondary-spark detector: replaced with a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly in 1890)
    => Maximum distance reached 3200 km

## The Fleming diode and De Forest Audion
  + 1904:  Sir John Ambrose Fleming invented the diode
  + 1906:  Lee De Forest invented the Audion.

## Early research by commercial companies
  + First commercial company to be incorporated for the manufacture of radio apparatus: the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, Ltd. (July 1897)
  + 1912: Lee De Forest discovered the oscillating properties of his Audion tube
  => Spark transmitter was replaced by electronic tube oscillator (=> generate much purer radio waves of relatively stable frequency)
  + 1910: 
    - radio messages between land stations and ships had become commonplace
    - the first air-to-ground radio contact was established from an aircraft
  + 1915: the American Telephone & Telegraph Company successfully (the first) transmitted speech signals from west to east across the Atlantic (between Arlington, Virginia, and Paris)
  + 1948: electron tube was invented

# Means of broadcasting
Broadcasting transmission (sound and television) uses both wires and radio waves (wireless).

# Broadcast Models

There are 4 types of broadcast models : 1.Flat Model 2.Circular Multi Disk Model 3.Multi Disk Model 4.Skewed Model

## Flat Model 
1. The server broadcasts the data as per cyclic requests without taking into account the number of devices that subscribe to a particular record. 
2. Flat disk has the best expected performance for uniform page access probabilities.

## Circular Multi Disk Model 
1. Each block of records pushed with a repetition rate proportional to its hierarchical level 
2. Record blocks R0,R1,R2,R3,R0,R1,R2,R3 transmitted in a single broadcast cycle. 
3. All record blocks have an equal priority level.

## Multi Disk Model 
1. Here broadcast is structured as multiple disks of varying sizes, each spinning at various rates. 
2. Consider the below example where page A was stored on a single page disk and that is spinning twice as fast as the second two-page disk containing pages B and C.

## Skewed Model 
1. In this model subsequent broadcast of more important data is clustered together. 
2. The data items are organized into the disks depending on their respective frequencies of access. 
3. The data items most frequently accessed are placed in the fastest disk and least accessed in the slowest disk.
4. Expected waiting time for data with less importance is much higher than that of important data. 
5. For skewed access probabilities, non-flat programs are better.

# Types of radio broadcasting
## 1. AM
### Overview
1. AM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed.
2. AM is short for amplitude modulation.
3. AM is a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted.
4. The medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting.
5. Some North American stations began broadcasting in AM stereo, though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold.
### Pros
1. It can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed.
2. An unpowered crystal radio receiver is enough to receive AM signal.
### Cons
1. The signal is subject to interference from electrical storms (lightning) and other electromagnetic interference (EMI).

## 2. FM
### Overview
1. FM refers to frequency modulation.
2. It occurs on VHF airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz everywhere except Japan and Russia.
3. Edwin Howard Armstrong invented FM radio.
4. FM channels are 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) apart, instead of 10 kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US.
### Pros
1. Invulnerable to radio-frequency interference (RFI), unlike AM.
2. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environment.
### Cons
1. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion.

## 3. Pirate radio
### Overview
1. Pirate radio is illegal or non-regulated radio transmission, unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or shortwave signals over a wide range.
2. They are illegal broadcasting for entertainment or political purposes, sometimes illegal two-way radio operation.
3. Historically there has been occasional use of sea vessels—fitting the most common perception of a pirate—as broadcasting bases.
## 4. Terrestrial digital radio
### Overview
1. Digital radio broadcasting has emerged, first in Europe (the UK in 1995 and Germany in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and many other countries worldwide.
2. The simplest system is named DAB Digital Radio, for Digital Audio Broadcasting, used mainly in the UK and South Africa.
3. The broadcasting regulators of the United States and Canada have chosen to use HD radio, an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast.
4. HD Radio is owned by a consortium of private companies that is called iBiquity.

# Mechanism of wave propagation
A radio wave is made up of electric and magnetic fields vibrating mutually at right angles to each other in space. When these two fields are operating synchronously in time, they are said to be in time phase; in other words, both reach their maxima and minima together and both go through zero together. </br></br>
As the distance from the source of energy increases, the area over which the electric and magnetic energy is spread is increased, so that the available energy per unit area is decreased. </br></br>
Radio signal intensity, like light intensity, decreases as the distance from the source increases. </br></br>
A transmitting antenna is a device that projects the radio-frequency energy generated by a transmitter into space. </br></br>
The antenna can be designed to concentrate the radio energy into a beam like a searchlight and so increase its effectiveness in a given direction.
# Frequency bands
The radio-frequency spectrum is divided arbitrarily into a number of bands from very low frequencies to superhigh frequencies (described in Table 4). </br></br>

<p> Sections of the spectrum have been allocated to the various users (described in table 5). </p>
